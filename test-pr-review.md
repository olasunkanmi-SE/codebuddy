# PR Review Enhancement Test

This file is created to test the enhanced PR review functionality.

## Changes Made:
- Enhanced PR review to use VS Code's git integration
- Added fallback mechanisms for when git detection fails
- Improved file content reading and analysis
- Added support for multiple programming languages

## Features:
- Detects actual changed files instead of returning "0 modified files"
- Uses VS Code's native git API when available
- Falls back to recent file detection when git fails
- Provides actual code content for review instead of empty diffs

This should help the PR review command provide meaningful feedback instead of hypothetical reviews.
