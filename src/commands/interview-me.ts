   - "What architectural improvements would you suggest for better scalability?"

2. **System Design**:
   - "How would this component fit into a microservices architecture?"
   - "What caching strategies would you implement here?"
   - "How would you handle this at scale (1M+ users)?"

#### ‚ö° **Performance & Optimization (25%)**
1. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - "What's the time/space complexity of this algorithm?"
   - "How would you optimize this for better performance?"
   - "What bottlenecks do you identify in this code?"

2. **Memory Management**:
   - "Are there any memory leaks in this implementation?"
   - "How would you handle garbage collection considerations?"

#### üîí **Security & Best Practices (20%)**
1. **Security Review**:
   - "What security vulnerabilities do you see here?"
   - "How would you sanitize inputs in this function?"
   - "What authentication/authorization concerns exist?"

2. **Error Handling**:
   - "How would you improve error handling in this code?"
   - "What edge cases are missing?"

#### üß™ **Testing & Quality (15%)**
1. **Test Strategy**:
   - "How would you test this function comprehensively?"
   - "What mocking strategy would you use?"
   - "How would you handle testing async operations here?"

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Debugging & Troubleshooting (10%)**
1. **Problem Solving**:
   - "If this code was causing performance issues in production, how would you debug it?"
   - "What logging would you add for better observability?"

## Interview Questions

### üìù **Technical Deep-Dive Questions**

#### **Beginner Level (1-2 years)**
1. **Code Understanding**: 
   - "Walk me through what this code does step by step"
   - "What would happen if we passed null/undefined to this function?"

2. **Basic Concepts**:
   - "Explain the difference between these two approaches in the code"
   - "What programming concepts are demonstrated here?"

#### **Intermediate Level (3-5 years)**
1. **Design Decisions**: 
   - "Why do you think the developer chose this data structure?"
   - "What are the trade-offs of this implementation?"

2. **Improvements**:
   - "How would you refactor this code for better maintainability?"
   - "What design patterns would you apply here?"

#### **Senior Level (5+ years)**
1. **System Architecture**:
   - "How would you scale this component for millions of users?"
   - "What would your deployment strategy be for this code?"

2. **Technical Leadership**:
   - "How would you guide a junior developer working on this code?"
   - "What code review feedback would you provide?"

### üéØ **Scenario-Based Questions**
1. **Production Issues**: 
   - "This code is causing timeouts in production. What's your investigation approach?"
   - "Memory usage is spiking. How do you identify the root cause?"

2. **Feature Enhancement**:
   - "Product wants to add real-time features. How would you modify this?"
   - "How would you add internationalization support?"

### üîç **Follow-Up Questions**
- "Can you think of an alternative implementation?"
- "What would break if we changed X to Y?"
- "How would you monitor this in production?"
- "What documentation would you add?"

## Answer Guide

### ‚úÖ **Expected Responses & Follow-ups**

#### **Performance Questions**
\`\`\`typescript
// Example: O(n¬≤) to O(n) optimization
// Original: Nested loops
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < others.length; j++) {
    if (items[i].id === others[j].id) { /* match */ }
  }
}

// Optimized: Hash map lookup
const otherMap = new Map(others.map(item => [item.id, item]));
for (const item of items) {
  const match = otherMap.get(item.id); // O(1) lookup
}
\`\`\`

#### **Architecture Improvements**
\`\`\`typescript
// Before: Tightly coupled
class OrderService {
  processOrder(order) {
    // Direct database calls
    // Email service calls
    // Payment processing
  }
}

// After: Dependency injection & separation
class OrderService {
  constructor(
    private repository: OrderRepository,
    private emailService: EmailService,
    private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor
  ) {}
}
\`\`\`

### üìä **Scoring Criteria**
- **Technical Accuracy**: Correct understanding of concepts
- **Problem-Solving**: Logical approach to challenges
- **Communication**: Clear explanation of complex topics
- **Best Practices**: Knowledge of industry standards
- **Experience**: Real-world application insights
