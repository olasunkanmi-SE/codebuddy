# MCP-Powered Specialist Agents with A2A Communication

This documentation outlines the design and implementation approach for a system of specialized AI agents that leverage the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the @a2a-js/sdk for standardized agent-to-agent communication and collaboration.

## Overview

The system consists of domain-specific agents, each equipped with specialized tools and knowledge to excel in their respective fields. These agents communicate through A2A protocols to collaborate on complex tasks that require multi-domain expertise.

## Core Concepts

- **MCP Integration**: Each agent uses MCP to access domain-specific tools and resources via OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication (updated for MCP Spec 2025-06-18)
- **A2A SDK Communication**: Uses @a2a-js/sdk for standardized inter-agent communication patterns
- **Domain Specialization**: Agents are designed to be experts in specific technical domains
- **Dual-Protocol Architecture**: MCP for tool execution, A2A for agent coordination
- **Centralized Authorization**: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server for secure MCP resource access
